# javascript-colour-picker
A javascript colour picker with slider bars. I created this back in 2006 and offered it for download on my old site. I was just going through my computer and found this again. It still works!

launch the colour_picker.html in your browser to see it run.

Feel free to use and modify it in anyway you want. All I ask is that orignal credit remains in the JS files.
